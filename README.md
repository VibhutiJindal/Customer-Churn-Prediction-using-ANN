# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ANN

Customer churn prediction is to measure why customers are leaving a business.

# Objective

We will build a deep learning model to predict the churn and use precision,recall, f1-score to measure performance of our model

# Dataset

taken from kaggle 

https://www.kaggle.com/saliblue/customer-churn-prediction/data

# Content

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

# Steps Involved.

1) Loading the Dataset

2) Data Analysis

3) Data Processing

4) Data Visualization
